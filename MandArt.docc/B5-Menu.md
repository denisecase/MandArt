# Menu

The MandArt application uses a standard macOS menu layout with some custom commands tailored to managing your artwork. Below is an overview of the available menus and their functions.

## File

- **Reset MandArt**  
Resets the current MandArt document to its default state. This is useful when your artwork becomes too cluttered and you want to start fresh.

- **Open MandArt from URL…**  
Opens a MandArt file by downloading a `.mandart` JSON file from a specified URL (for example, files hosted on GitHub).

- **Open MandArt from Machine…**  
Opens a MandArt file from your local machine.

- **Save MandArt**  
Saves the current MandArt document.

- **Save MandArt As…**  
Saves the current MandArt document under a new name or location.

- **Export as PNG**  
Exports the current MandArt image as a PNG file.

*Note: In addition to these custom commands, you can still use the native macOS File menu options such as New, Open, and Open Recent if needed.*

## View

- **Full Screen**  
Use the View menu to enter or exit full screen mode, maximizing your workspace when needed.

## Window

- **Window Management**  
The Window menu lets you minimize, zoom, or arrange your window (e.g., move the window left or right). Since MandArt is designed as a single-window application, many advanced window arrangements (like tabbing or tiling) are disabled.

## Help

- **MandArt Help**  
Opens the help documentation for using MandArt.

- **MandArt Discoveries**  
Opens the MandArt Discoveries website, where you can explore creative examples and ideas.
